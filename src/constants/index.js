export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
I am a dedicated and versatile full-stack developer with a passion for creating efficient and user-friendly web applications. I have experience working with a variety of technologies, including React, Next.js, Node.js, Actix Web, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, as well as Redis and Kafka for scalable backend solutions. My journey in web development began with a deep curiosity for how things work, and it has evolved into a career where I continuously strive to learn and adapt to new challenges.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions. Currently, Iâ€™m expanding my skill set by exploring Three.js to create immersive 3D web experiences. Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies, and contributing to open-source projects.`;
